== Install Instructions for Intel Mac OS X ==

The following instructions detail how to get a development
environment setup for Zimbra on an Intel Mac running OS X. In
each section below, links to the necessary software is provided.
However, many of these packages are already downloaded and are
available at http://depot/public/software/ so try there first. 

Some notes on the software:

   * Perforce - the PPC version will work fine
   * MySQL - you MUST install the x86 version, version 5 (or higher)
   * OpenLDAP - install the latest version
   * Tomcat - install 5.5.15 (or higher)


=== Perforce ===

Download and install client from http://perforce.com/perforce/downloads/macosx102ppc.html

Setup p4 client with following information:

P4USER = {user_name}
P4PORT = eric:1666
P4CLIENT = {client_name}

Views:

<pre>
//depot/main/ThirdParty/openldap/builds/MACOSXx86/... //{client_name}/ThirdParty/openldap/builds/MACOSXx86/...
//depot/main/ZimbraServer/... //{client_name}/ZimbraServer/...
</pre>

After you setup Perforce, login and sync the client. This will get
you all of the files that you will need for the rest of the install.
Afterwards you can update your p4 client information to include the
various views that you need for development.

If you want to sync all of the necessary files to start working
on the client code, then add the following to your list of views:

<pre>
//depot/main/Ajax/... //{client_name}/Ajax/...
//depot/main/ZimbraWebClient/... //{client_name}/ZimbraWebClient/...
</pre>

Note: After you follow all of the steps in this guide, you will
no longer need //depot/main/ThirdParty/... in your list of P4
views.


=== Setup /opt/zimbra ===

Open a terminal shell and run the following commands:

<pre>
% sudo su -
% mkdir -p /opt/zimbra
% chown {user_name}:{user_name} /opt/zimbra
% exit
</pre>


=== Install MySQL ===

Download and install from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html

Note: Install *both* packages so that MySQL will automatically start
when you boot.

Run the following commands:

<pre>
% sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql /opt/zimbra/mysql
</pre>

Then edit the file /opt/zimbra/mysql/data/my.cnf, type in the
following, and save:

<pre>
[mysqld]
bind-address = localhost
port = 7306
</pre>

Now you should be able to start MySQL with the following command:
[Note: you may have to reboot in order for this to work]

<pre>
% sudo SystemStarter start MySQL
</pre>


=== Install OpenLDAP ===

Extract .tar.gz from {p4_client_local_dir}/ThirdParty/openldap/builds/MACOSXx86/
into /opt/zimbra/

Run the following command:

<pre>
% ln -s /opt/zimbra/{openldap_extract_dir} /opt/zimbra/openldap
</pre>

Then run "sudo vi /etc/sudoers" and add the following at the
end of the file and save:

<pre>
{user_name}{TAB}ALL=NOPASSWD:/opt/zimbra/openldap/libexec/slapd
<pre>


=== Install Ant ===

Download from http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Extract the .tar.gz file to someplace useful and add to your
PATH.


=== Install Tomcat ===

Download from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-55.cgi

Extract the .tar.gz file into /opt/zimbra/ and run the following
commands

<pre>
% ln -s /opt/zimbra/{tomcat_extract_dir} /opt/zimbra/tomcat
% cd {p4_client_local_dir}/ZimbraServer/
% cp conf/tomcat-5.5/* /opt/zimbra/tomcat/conf/
% ant tomcat-init
</pre>


=== Deploy Zimbra ===

Deploy Zimbra with the following commands:

<pre>
% cd {p4_client_local_dir}/ZimbraServer
% ant reset-the-world
</pre>

If you added the views needed for web client development in
the Perforce step above, you can now deploy the application
with the following commands:

<pre>
% cd {p4_client_local_dir}/ZimbraWebServer
% ant deploy
</pre>

You should now be able to point your browser to the following
URL and login with the username "user1" and password "test123":

<pre>
http://localhost:7070/zimbra/
</pre>


=== Install Mail Transfer Agent ===

In order to send mail to/from users in the Zimbra product
you will need a mail transfer agent. However, you do not need
a full MTA such as Postfix in order for this to work. Instead,
you can install a Perl script that acts as a simple MTA.

NOTE: In order to continue with this step, you need to have
installed the Mac OS X development tools. If you haven't done
this yet, insert disc 1 and install Xcode Tools/XcodeTools.mpkg

First, you need to install some Perl packages by running
the following commands: [The first time you run CPAN, you
will need to configure it -- use default settings where
possible]

<pre>
% sudo cpan
</pre>

At the CPAN prompt, type the following commands:

<pre>
cpan> install Net::SMTP::Server
cpan> install Net::LMTP
cpan> install Net::DNS
cpan> quit
</pre>

Now you can run the Perl MTA with the following commands:

<pre>
% export ZIMBRA_HOSTNAME=`/opt/zimbra/bin/zmhostname`
% sudo perl {p4_client_local_dir}/ZimbraServer/src/perl/zMTAHack.pl
</pre>

NOTE: When sending mail, you need to fully qualify the
address as {username}@{hostname}. The {username} is
"user1" through "user5". The {hostname} is the same one
that /opt/zimbra/bin/zmhostname displays.


=== Configuring Services to Start at Boot ===

At this point, only MySQL is configured to start at boot.
If you want the other services (i.e. LDAP, Tomcat, and
MTA) to start at boot, you need to run the following
commands:

<pre>
TODO
</pre>
