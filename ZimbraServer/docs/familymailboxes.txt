Provisioning
============

There is no SOAP or zmprov API for creating family accounts.  Provisioning-wise, family accounts are just 
regular accounts with two additional multi-valued LDAP attributes: zimbraChildAccount and zimbraChildVisibleAccount,  
which link a primary(parent) account to its secondary(child) accounts.

There are two types of secondary accounts: visible and invisible.  Visible secondary accounts are those shown 
in the account accordion UI when a primary logs in.  Invisible secondary accounts are not shown in the accordion, 
but they work the same in all other aspects as visible secondary accounts.

A primary account can see and manage preferences and mail items on all its secondary accounts.  

Attribute zimbraFeatureOptionsEnabled controls if an account can see and change any account preferences.
zimbraFeatureOptionsEnabled should be set to FALSE on secondary accounts if secondary accounts are not allowed 
to see/manage their preferences.


Examples:
=========
- Create secondary accounts:
    zmprov createAccount child-1@zimbra.com test123 zimbraFeatureOptionsEnabled FALSE {other attr/value pairs}
    zmprov createAccount child-2@zimbra.com test123 zimbraFeatureOptionsEnabled FALSE {other attr/value pairs}

- Create a primary account and link secondary accounts to it:
    zmprov createAccount parent@zimbra.com test123 zimbraChildAccount {id-of-child-1} zimbraChildAccount {id-of-child-2} zimbraChildVisibleAccount {id-of-child-1}
    
    or can do in two steps:
    zmprov createAccount parent@zimbra.com test123
    zmprov modifyAccount parent@zimbra.com zimbraChildAccount {id-of-child-1} zimbraChildAccount {id-of-child-2} zimbraChildVisibleAccount {id-of-child-1}
    
    The above example adds child-1@zimbra.com and child-2@zimbra.com as secondary accounts of parent@zimbra.com; 
    child-1@zimbra.com is visible, child-2@zimbra.com is not visible.
    Note: for visible secondary accounts, they have to appear in both zimbraChildAccount and zimbraChildVisibleAccount attributes.
