Mail Filtering Functional Specification

Overview

This document specifies the features, user interfaces, SOAP API, and
LDAP schema for filtering mails. Mail filtering allows a user to
define a set of rules. When an incoming email matches a rule (e.g., if
a mail is a check-in message), its corresponding action is taken
(e.g., file into CVS folder).

Architecture

Filtering happens on the server side when mails arrive from the MTA
and before they are deposited into mailboxes.

Rules are expressed as a Sieve script as defined by RFC 3028. Here is
an example:

    #
    # Example Sieve Filter
    # Declare any optional features or extension used by the script
    #
    require ["fileinto", "reject", "tag"];

    #
    # Reject any large messages (note that the four leading dots get
    # "stuffed" to three)
    #
    if size :over 1M
            {
            discard;
       stop;
            }
    #
    # Handle messages from known mailing lists
    # Move messages from IETF filter discussion list to filter folder
    #
    if header :is "Sender" "owner-ietf-mta-filters@imc.org"
            {
            fileinto "/mailinglist";  # move to "mailinglist" folder
            }
    #
    # Keep all messages to or from people in my company
    #
    elsif address :domain :is ["From", "To"] "zimbra.com"
            {
            keep;               # keep in "In" folder
            }

    #
    # Try and catch unsolicited email.  If a message is not to me,
    # or it contains a subject known to be spam, file it away.
    #
    elsif anyof (not address :all :contains
                   ["To", "Cc", "Bcc"] "me@zimbra.com",
                 header :matches "subject"
                   ["*make*money*fast*", "*university*dipl*mas*"])
            {
            # If message header does not contain my address,
            # it's from a list.
            fileinto "/Junk";   # move to "junk" folder
            }
    else
            {
            # Tag all other (non-company) mail as "personal"
            tag "personal";
            }

Features

1. Tests

We support the following tests in rules:

* Any word in the headers, most common ones including From, To, Cc,
  Bcc, Subject.  See RFC 3028.

  E.g.,

  if header :contains "From" "foo" { action; }

* Any word in the body of the message. Zimbra specific. 
    body :contains string

  E.g.,

  if body :contains "foo" { action; }

* Date or date range in the Date header. Zimbra specific. 
    date {:before | :after} "yyyyMMdd"

  E.g.,

  if date :before "20041112" { action; }
  if allof(date :before "20041231", date :after "20040101") { action; }

* Any full address, local part or domain part of an address in
  headers. See RFC 3028. E.g.,

  if address :all :contains "From" "foo" { action; }

  This feature is not exposed in UI.
  
* An address (sender and/or recipients) is in the user's
  contacts. Zimbra specific.  
    addressbook :in header "contacts"  

  E.g.,

  if addressbook :in "From" "contacts" { action; }

* Mail size. See RFC 3028. E.g.,

  if size :over 1M { action; }

* Any meta information about attachments. This is limited to test the
  existence of the attachments. Zimbra specific. E.g.,

  if attachment { action; }

We support the following matches in the above tests.

* Case-sensitive string matches
* Case-insensitive string matches
* Equality
* Substring matches
* Wildcards (* matches zero or more characters, ? matches a single character)
* Existence of headers

Tests can be combined with the following:

* All of
* Any of
* Not

Disabled rules can appear with other rules in the script using
disabled_if. E.g.:

    disabled_if header contains "From" "foo" { action; }

The above rule will not be evaluated and its actions will never be
executed. This is a Zimbra specific feature.

To reduce complexity, we do NOT support tests of any word in
attachment for the moment. We index a message after it is delivered to
a mailbox, so at the time of filtering, we may not have the index
available yet.

2. Actions

We support the following actions when a rule matches:

* keep		saves a message to the user's INBOX.

* fileinto	saves a message to the specified folder. The folder name
  uses the path notation. E.g., /Drafts

* tag		tags a message with the named tag. 

* flag		flags a message as "flagged/unflagged" or "read/unread"

* discard	throws away a message

* stop		stops further evaluation if the current rule is matched

* redirect	forward email to another address

The actions of reject is NOT supported at the moment.

If a condition is met, multiple actions may be specified. The
behaviors of the following combination of actions are:

* discard: if combined with other actions, discard is ignored and the
  other actions will take place. This behavor is specified by RFC 3028.

* stop: actions after stop will be ignored and will not be executed.

* fileinto: multiple fileinto actions result in multiple copies of the
  message be stored in different folders.

* tag, flag: these actions apply to the message returned from the next
  (implicit) keep or fileinto actions. E.g.:

  if header :is "From" "boss@firm.com" {
	tag "Important";
	fileinto "/Boss";    # msg1 is in Boss folder, 
                         # and tagged Important
	flag "flagged";		
	fileinto "/Archive"; # msg2 is in Archive folder
                         # and marked as flagged
	tag "FromBoss";		
	keep;                # msg3 is in INBOX and
                         # tagged FromBoss
  }

  If tag/flag actions are the last actions specified, they will be applied 
  to *previous* message produced by fileinto/keep action. E.g.,
  
  fileinto "/Boss";
  tag "Important";       # message is in Boss folder and 
                         # tagged Important

  
* keep: multiple keep actions can be specified. But only one copy of
  the message will be saved in INBOX.

* redirect can be combined with any other actions. E.g., one can keep 
  a copy of the message in INBOX and forward it to another address
  
At message delivery time, if a specified tag does not exist, the
message is not tagged. The UI is expected to help avoid this problem
by presenting all available tags as a drop-down list when the rule is
configured.

If a specified folder does not exist, the message is saved to
INBOX. The UI is expected to show a list of available folders when the
rule is configured.

3. Rule creation and editing

A UI will be provided to allow users to create/edit rules and
actions. The system must support:

* The server accepts rules and actions from the client and generates
  the equivalent Sieve script.

* The server shall validate the rules and actions submitted from the
  client.

* The server sends an existing Sieve script to the client to be
  rendered in the UI.

*  Any tag and/or folder specified in the rules will be created
  automatically at the time rule creation/editing.

User Interface

The user interface can be accessed by selecting Options -> Filter Rules tab.
 
This screen allows a single rule to be created. When user presses the
+ button, additional condition can be created and either and'ed or
or'ed with the existing condition, depending on the selection of "All
of" or "Any of".

The order of the rules on screen is significant. It is the order that
they will be evaluated, from top to bottom, on the server side when
mails are filtered.

A "raw" script screen will NOT be provided.


jSieve Integration

We use a Java implementation of Sieve from Apache James called jSieve. 
It does not seem to be actively developed.

The integration point of jSieve into Zimbra is the ZimbraServer/conf/sieveConfig.xml
file, which is copied to tomcat/webapps/service/WEB-INF/classes after deployment.
It maps Sieve commands (tests, actions, controls) to Java classes that implement
the commands. We already have a number of Zimbra extensions (disabled_if, tag, flag,
date, body, attachment, addressbook) defined in there.

We have patched the jSieve code itself because it had synchronization problems.
We also add a parameter to the ActionKeep class to distinguish between explicit
and implicit keep. The source code is located at:

ThirdParty/jsieve/trunk

Use the build.bat or build.sh to build the source. The generated jsieve-0.1.jar file
is then checked into ZimbraCommon/jars.

Hmmm. I guess we should add a pointer in the main James page under
subprojects. jSieve exists as a subproject of James and its SVN 
repository
is https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/james/jsieve. The core 
functionality is
complete and ready for integration into any Java environment, but it 
hasn't
really been tested in the real world. It is designed to be pluggable 
into
any Java code - I use it within a mailet wrapper, I doubt anyone else 
does.

It isn't part of James yet as to be functional it requires a 
MessageStore to
expose a set of operations comparable with those provided by IMAP.  
Others
are working on an IMAP store for James. When this is done it should be 
a
short step to integrate James and jSieve.

SOAP API

1. Getting all rules for a mailbox

<GetRulesRequest>
</GetRulesRequest>

<GetRulesResponse>
  <rules>
  <!-- rule -->
  <r name="{rule name}" active="0|1">
     <!-- conditions -->
     <g op="{anyof | allof}">
       <c name="{test name}" [mod="{modifier}"] op="{comparator}"
       [k0="{lhs}"] k1="{rhs}"/>+
     </g>
     <!-- actions -->
     <action name="{action name}">
       <arg>{argument value}</arg>*
     </action>+
  </r>*
  </rules>
</GetRulesResponse>

* {test name} contains "header", "size", "body", etc. 
* {mod} is the test modifier, and is only meaningful for a few tests like address. In that case it indicates what part of address is to be matched, :localpart, :domain, or :all.
* {comparator} contains ":is", "not :is", ":contains", "not :contains", ":matches", "not :matches" etc. 
* {lhs} is the left hand side of a condition, such as the header names like "From", "To", etc. 
* {rhs} is the key
* {action name} is "fileinto", "keep", "tag", etc.

2. Saving rules for a mailbox

<SaveRulesRequest>
  <rules>
    <!-- rule -->
    <r name="{rule name}" active="0|1">
       <!-- conditions -->
       <g op="{anyof | allof}">
         <c name="{test name}" [mod="{modifier}"] op="{comparator}"
       [k0="{lhs}"] k1="{rhs}"/>+
       </g>
       <!-- actions -->
       <action name="{action name}">
         <arg>{argument value}</arg>*
       </action>+
    </r>*
  </rules>
</SaveRulesRequest>

<SaveRulesResponse>
</SaveRulesResponse>

Or a SOAP fault indicating validation errors.

LDAP Schema

In zimbraAccount objectClass, an attribute of zimbraMailSieveScript is
defined to hold the Sieve script in its source form.

Issues

The following issues have been raised. They are deferred to a later release:

1. Can we use the same indexing engine in mail filtering? Can we allow
filter rules to be created using the client browse constraints? This
way we avoid two separate search engines and offer a more powerful
filtering feature. The challenge is how to do this efficiently so that
the LMTP mail delivery loop can be completed as quickly as possible.

2. redirect

If the specified redirect address is invalid (either syntactically or
found in SendFailedException.getInvalidAddresses()), the message is bounced
to the sender. This is because retry would repeat the same failures endlessly.

Other errors LMTP will retry the message delivery (i.e., redirect).

If the redirected message encounters problems further down the route,
the message is bounced to the sender.

Based on the RFC, 
"The redirect command performs an MTA-style "forward"--that is, what
   you get from a .forward file using sendmail under UNIX.  The address
   on the SMTP envelope is replaced with the one on the redirect command
   and the message is sent back out.  (This is not an MUA-style forward,
   which creates a new message with a different sender and message ID,
   wrapping the old message in a new one.)

   Implementations SHOULD take measures to implement loop control,
   possibly including adding headers to the message or counting received
   headers.  If an implementation detects a loop, it causes an error."
   
Received header is added by JavaMail automatically. We are not adding any
Resent-* headers because gmail and others (e.g., email forward from Stanford)
do not add these headers.

3. Run the rules against INBOX or a particular folder?


Appendix: Comparison with Outlook

Here's the list of tests supported by Outlook. Those tests also
supported by us are flagged with a *.

a. From people or distribution list *
b. With specific words in the subject *
c. Through the specified account *
d. Sent only to me *
e. Where my name is in the To box *
f. Marked as importance
g. Marked as sensitivity
h. Flagged for action
i. Where my name is in the Cc, To box *
j. Where my name is not in the To box *
k. Sent to people or distribution list *
l. With specific words in Subject , body *
m. With specific words in the message header *
n. With specific words in the recipient*s address *
o. With specific words in the sender*s address *
p. Assigned to category *
q. Which is an Out of Office message *
r. Which has an attachment *
s. With size in a specific range *
t. Received in a specific date span *
u. Uses the form name form
v. With selected properties of documents or forms
w. Sender is in specified Address Book *
x. Which is a meeting invitation or update
y. On this machine only *

We can support f, g, h if we allow application of filters on the
messages that are already in the INBOX. We can support x when we are
done implementing calendar. Outlook category would be equivalent to
our tags. Tests u, v are specific to Outlook.

The following is a list of actions supported by Outlook. 

a. Move it to the specified folder *
b. Assign it to the category *
c. Delete it *
d. Permanently delete it
e. Move a copy to the specified folder *
f. Forward it to people or distribution list
g. Forward it to people or distribution list as an attachment
h. Redirect it to people or distribution list
i. Have server reply using a specific message
j. Reply using a specific template
k. Flag message for action in a number of days
l. Flag message with a colored flag *
m. Clear the Message Flag *
n. Mark it as importance *
o. Print it
p. Play a sound
q. Start an application
r. Mark it as read
s. Run a script
t. Stop processing more rules *
u. Perform a custom action
v. Display a specific message in the New Item Alert window
w. Display a Desktop Alert

Items f, g, h, i can be supported easily by implementing the redirect
and reject actions defined by RFC 3028. We only have one flag.

Appendix: Implementation notes

The Sieve script for each mailbox is stored in source form in
LDAP. Each if or elsif defines a rule. The name of the rule is defined
in the comment immediately precedes the if or elsif command. Any
number of white spaces can be present in between. For example:

    #
    # Handle messages from known mailing lists
    # Move messages from IETF filter discussion list to filter folder
    # 
    # mailing list rule
  
    if header :is "Sender" "owner-ietf-mta-filters@imc.org"
            {
            fileinto "/mailinglist";  # move to "mailinglist" folder
            }
    #
    # Keep all messages to or from people in my company
    #
    # save my mail rule
  
    elsif address :domain :is ["From", "To"] "zimbra.com"
            {
            keep;               # keep in "In" folder
            }

    #
    # Try and catch unsolicited email.  If a message is not to me,
    # or it contains a subject known to be spam, file it away.
    #
    # spam rule
  
    elsif anyof (not address :all :contains
                   ["To", "Cc", "Bcc"] "me@zimbra.com",
                 header :matches "subject"
                   ["*make*money*fast*", "*university*dipl*mas*"])
            {
            # If message header does not contain my address,
            # it's from a list.
            fileinto "/Junk";   # move to "junk" folder
            }

When sending Sieve script to the client for editing, we descend the
parsed tree and generate the XML condition/action elements in the SOAP
response.
