    /**
     * An IndexItem transaction is always created as a sub-transaction
     * of a mail item create/modify transaction.  Delicate ordering of
     * log/commit of IndexItem, log/commit of the parent transaction,
     * and database commit is required for correct handling of crash
     * recovery, i.e. to avoid redoing an Index operation before redoing
     * the creation or value modification of the item being indexed.
     * 
     * In particular, the commit record for IndexItem should never be
     * written to the redo stream before the commit record for the
     * parent transaction.  The Mailbox class manages all aspects of
     * redo logging except IndexItem commit, which is done in batch by
     * indexer for performance reasons.  Typically the natural delay
     * introduced by the batching ensures IndexItem is committed some
     * time after parent transaction commit, but a boundary case exists
     * in which the batch commit occurs before the main thread writes
     * commit record for parent transaction.
     * 
     * To avoid that case, an IndexItem record is created in
     * commit-blocked mode.  Batch index commit thread will skip all
     * IndexItem transactions that are not allowed to commit yet.  The
     * main thread will unblock IndexItem commit after it has written
     * the commit record for the parent transaction.
