/**
 * Provider for authorization policies. Policy decisions are
 * not based on any storage or specific options.  They are 
 * ment to be broad sweeping policies, and are often implemented
 * with a simple pattern matching algorithm. For a large 
 * majority of sites, a policy will be all that is required.
 *
 * Users that wish to integrate with their own authorization 
 * system must extend this class and implement the 
 * AuthorizationProvider interface then register the class
 * with Wildfire in the <tt>wildfire.xml</tt> file. An entry 
 * in that file would look like the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;provider&gt;
 *     &lt;authorizationpolicy&gt;
 *       &lt;classlist&gt;com.foo.auth.CustomPolicyProvider&lt;/classlist&gt;
 *     &lt;/authorizationpolicy&gt;
 *   &lt;/provider&gt;</pre>
